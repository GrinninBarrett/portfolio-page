## Challenges
The portfolio page is a project in its own right, but is also a great chance to showcase some of the other projects I've worked on. While it took a while to fine-tune everything and get it looking exactly like I wanted, I found that this came much easier than previous attempts at building sites from the ground up. I chose to use pure CSS rather than a framework, both for the practice, and to show that I don't need to rely on frameworks to make a quality site. However, CSS continues to be one of the more challenging aspects of web design for me, but each time I make something like this, I learn something new. 

I needed to learn several new pieces of functionality for this project, including adding a downloadable file and copying a particular piece of text to the user's clipboard. The latter took a while to find a satisfactory answer, and while it seems like one of those things that should be easier, I think the way I implemented it really seems to be the best/only way. 

I used exclusively Flexbox for the design of the pages. While the site is not designed in a mobile-first fashion, this was by choice, as I believe most people viewing my portfolio will likely be doing so from a computer. However, I made sure to make the site fully responsive for various screen sizes, so all layouts and functionality will be easy to navigate and use regardless of the user's device.


## Future Development
* Add more animations to page components for improved visual effect
* Use Lighthouse report to reach a perfect accessibility score
* Use a photo hosting service (such as Cloudinary) to optimize the speed of page loading
